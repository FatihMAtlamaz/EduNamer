The overall purpose of this code is to supplement Canvas in order to better organize assignments.
This project will implement the use of another code which is not shown in this project to access
the Canvas API and pull the name of the student, assignment, and date submitted. Thus 
in order to actually run the project, example code is used to simulate that information.
This information is then used to rename the file and make a new folder with the assignment name
if it doesn't already exist. The newly renamed files are then added to the new folder.
For example, if a student named Billy Bob submitted an assignment titled Food Truck Lab but the
file was named Document 1 it would rename the file as "Billy Bob + Food Truck Lab + 2022-01-21"
and then put it in a folder named Food Truck Lab. In the future, we will attempt to get access to the Canvas API in order to make it so that every person can use this program. With the Canvas API, the students’ first and last names won’t be hardcoded, and the program won’t have to be run one by one for each file.
